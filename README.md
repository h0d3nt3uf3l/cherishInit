This APP is only for test purposes.

The APP is able to initialize the WIFI onto the Kodak Cherish Babymonitor, but after the restart in the setup-routine the camera is trying to connect to a server for 30 seconds. This connection is encrypted so I don't know about the content. After 30 seconds and several TCP packages (everytime the same content) the camera says "Setup failed", restart and flush it's memory.
